#### Lab1: Understand the definitions of various Amazon Web Services (AWS) and their use in cloud computing-based web applications that are accessible over the internet. I have used Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to configure, launch, and connect to a linux and windows instance.I have also used AWS CodeDeploy to deploy a webpage from GitHub to the EC2 instance

#### Lab2: Learn about Google’s core infrastructure and its Cloud Platform Compute Engine that delivers virtual machines running in Google’s worldwide fiber and data centers.

#### Lab3: Understand how to run ML model, create a flask application to serve the model, and deploy angular user interface on AWS EC2 instances. I have used two Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for running the ML model via flask API and Angular UI. I have also used AWS S3 to store our compiled model in python pickle format which is a way of storing objects, in my case will be saving output of ML model in python pickle format.

#### Lab4: This lab provides a walkthrough of the basics of the Kubernetes cluster orchestration system. Each module contains some background information on major Kubernetes features and concepts, and includes an interactive online tutorial.
